## Shaders
- New shaders have been introduced to perform GPU based sprite animations
- `Globals` uniform now has camera coordinates
- `block.vsh/fsh` copies `terrain.vsh/fsh` and handles ad-hoc blocks (e.g. held by entities)
- Added `ChunkSection` uniform, used by `terrain.vsh` (which replaces `DynamicTransforms`)
## Shaders - Post-processing Effects
- Added `animate_sprite*` core shaders, which use a new `SpriteAnimationInfo` uniform
- Sprites (textures as part of a larger atlas) are now animated on the GPU rather than per-tick on the CPU
- For regular frame-based animations, `animate_sprite.vsh` and `animate_sprite_blit.fsh` are used to perform the draw
- For interpolated animations, animate_sprite.vsh and `animate_sprite_interpolate.fsh` are used to perform the draw
- The UBO `SpriteAnimationInfo` contains information on where the sprite should be drawn to, within the greater texture atlas
