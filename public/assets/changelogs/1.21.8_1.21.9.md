# Shaders
- The `core/blit_screen.vsh`, `post/blit.vsh`, `post/blur.vsh`, `post/invert.vsh`, `post/sobel.vsh`, and `post/screenquad.vsh` shader programs have been removed and replaced by `core/screenquad.vsh`.
  - Vertex shaders for post-processing effects and full screen blits are no longer passed a `Position` attribute. These must assign vertex coordinates using `gl_VertexID` instead and are executed with 3 vertices
- Lightmap shader updated for the new end flash:
  - Removed `int UseBrightLightmap` uniform and added `vec3 AmbientColor` to the `LightmapInfo` uniform block
- Removed unused shaders: `position_color_lightmap`, `position_color_tex_lightmap`
- A `PER_FACE_LIGHTING` flag has been added to the `core/entity.vsh` and `core/entity.fsh` shaders
