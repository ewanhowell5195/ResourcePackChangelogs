# Additions
- Added new sound: `item.underwater_saddle.equip`

#  Changes
- All mipmap levels are once again animated for block animated textures
- Beacon and Redstone dust now support translucent textures
- `darkened_cutout_mipmap` field of the texture section of `*.mcmeta` files has been replaced by a new field `mipmap_strategy` with the following supported values:
  - `mean` averages both color and alpha between groups of four pixels for the current mipmap level to generate the next mipmap level pixel. This was and stays the default strategy for most solid or translucent full block textures
  - `dark_cutout` is similar to mean, but blends colors in a way that makes the pixels bordering cutout pixels darker. This was and stays the strategy for leaves and Mangrove Roots. It simulates dark interior of the blocks
  - `cutout` is a new strategy that always generates a mipmap based on the original texture instead of the previous mipmap. Used for most cutout blocks that became mipmapped in this version
  - `strict_cutout` is a modification of cutout that uses stricter alpha cutoff value leading to the textures using this value disappearing at higher mipmap levels. Is used for flowers and similar blocks to avoid artifacts
  - `auto` is the default value and will make the game to pick mean for textures that do not contain fully transparent pixels and cutout for those that do
