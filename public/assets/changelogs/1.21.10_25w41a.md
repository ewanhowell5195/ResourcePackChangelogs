# Additions
Added new item definitions, models, textures, and sounds for:
- Nautilus entity
- Zombie Nautilus entity
- Nautilus armor
- Spears

Added new UI slot sprites for:
- Nautilus armor
- Spear

# Changes
- Texture mcmeta: added `darkened_cutout_mipmap` to the `texture` section, eg: `{ texture: { darkened_cutout_mipmap: true } }`. When true, transparent pixels use black in mipmapped levels rather than the pixel's own color.
- Regular glass and glass panes now support translucent textures
- Celestials:
  - Sun, moon, and end flash textures moved to a `celestials` subfolder
  - Now use a dedicated celestials atlas and support texture animations
  - `moon_phases.png` has been split into individual textures for each phase
- Zombie horse texture has been redesigned (no UV changes; not a breaking change)

# Effect Backgrounds
The effect background textures that appear in your inventory have been adjusted.
- `effect_background_small.png` has been renamed to `effect_background.png`
- Added `effect_background_ambient.png` - Used by the new **Breath of the Nautilus** effect
- Removed `effect_background_large.png`

# Shader Changes
- Removed the `LineWidth` uniform from the `DynamicTransforms` uniform block.
   - `LineWidth` is now passed as a vertex attribute to the `core/rendertype_lines` and `core/debug_point` shaders instead.
- Added a vertex shader `core/debug_point.vsh` used for rendering some debug visuals
- The CUTOUT_MIPPED terrain pipeline has been removed
  - `ALPHA_CUTOUT` is now defined as `0.5` for the CUTOUT terrain pipeline
