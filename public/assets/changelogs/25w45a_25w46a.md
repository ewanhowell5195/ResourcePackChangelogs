# Additions
- Added texture `gui/container/nautilus` used for the Nautilus inventory UI
- Added texture `container/slot/nautilus_armor_inventory` - Nautilus icon used in Nautilus inventory UI
- Added sound event `entity.zombie_horse.eat`

# Changes
## Block Models
- Block model elements can now be rotated around multiple axes
- Model is first rotated around X, then Y, then Z
- New fields:
  - `x` - rotation around axis X in degrees, float, defaults to `0.0`
  - `y` - rotation around axis Y in degrees, float, defaults to `0.0`
  - `z` - rotation around axis Z in degrees, float, defaults to `0.0`
- Existing fields `axis` and `angle` can still be used
  - If both field sets are present, older notation takes presence
- Existing restriction for angle value limiting them to [-45, 45] has been removed
  - Note: Names of faces are not influenced by rotation. Features that depend on them, like culling, will always use original directions
## Block State Model Dispatch
- Variants in block state dispatch files (defined in `assets/.../blockstates/` can now be also rotated around Z axis
  - New optional field `z` has the same format as existing `x` and `y` fields: an integer with allowed values of `0` (default), `90`, `180` and `270`
  - Rotation around Z axis is applied after X and Y
## Bug Fixes
- Nautiluses' mouth texture is now properly aligned

- Parched UV mapping has been improved (still has some issues)
