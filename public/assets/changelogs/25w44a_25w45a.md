# Changes
- Item textures were split out of the blocks atlas into a separate new items atlas that does not have mipmaps
  - All textures used in an item model have to come from the same (`items` or `blocks`) atlas
  - All textures used in a block model have to come from the `blocks` atlas
  - __Depending on your model, this *could* cause some models to break__
